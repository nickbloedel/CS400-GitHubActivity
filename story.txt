Jiangang Chen:
  On Saturday, I ate a sandwich and mike in the morning. Then I made some Moon cake with my roommate for the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is in the Oct.1. Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional Chinese Festival that people will stay with their family and friends to watch the moon with some snacks. The moon on that day will be the largest and roundest in a year. Hopefully, the weather on that day will be nice. How about your day?

Nicholas Bloedel:
My Saturday was definitely not as productive as Jiangang's. My day consisted of waking up in the afternoon and watching YouTube videos for a large majority of the day. However, I wasn't completely lazy. I was able to get some homework done later in the night, and I was also able to study for other engineering courses I'm taking at the moment.
